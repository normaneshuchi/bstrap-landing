        <h2>Repayment Options</h2>
        <p>
          You'll choose a repayment term length between 7 and 20 years when you
          apply for your loan. Once it's disbursed, Prodigy Finance will place
          it in one of the following buckets:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              <strong>Deferment: </strong>
              This period lasts while you're in school, and for a six-month
              period after you graduate (known as the "grace period"). During
              this time you don't have to make payments, but you can if you’d
              like. Interest will continue to add up on your loan.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <strong>Full Repayment: </strong>
              After the six-month grace period has passed, you'll start making
              payments on the 28th of each month. Since the loans are
              variable-rate, your monthly payment amount can change as markets
              fluctuate.

            <h3>Step 4:</h3>
            <p>
              Upon approval, the loan is disbursed directly to your school for
              tuition and any remaining amount to your personal account for
              living expenses
