        <h2>Repayment Options</h2>
        <p>
          You'll choose a repayment term length between 7 and 20 years when you
          apply for your loan. Once it's disbursed, Prodigy Finance will place
          it in one of the following buckets:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              <strong>Deferment: </strong>
              This period lasts while you're in school, and for a six-month
              period after you graduate (known as the "grace period"). During
              this time you don't have to make payments, but you can if youâ€™d
              like. Interest will continue to add up on your loan.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <strong>Full Repayment: </strong>
              After the six-month grace period has passed, you'll start making
              payments on the 28th of each month. Since the loans are
              variable-rate, your monthly payment amount can change as markets
              fluctuate.
